    pip install cv2

2. keypoint_classification.py, point_history_classification.py, keypoint_classifier.py, and point_history_classifier.py

    Requires CUDA, CUDNN to be installed from the following websites if using a supported NVIDIA GPU for Tensorflow:
    
    Check whether or not NVIDIA GPU is compatible for use at https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus

    https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads <- Must add C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.x\bin to PATH

    https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn <-   Extract to C:\Program Files\NVIDIA\CUDNN\v8.6.0.163
                                            Add C:\Program Files\NVIDIA\CUDNN\v8.6.0.163\bin to PATH

    Requires Tensorflow, Tensorflow GPU, numpy, and scikit-learn. These libraries can be installed by running the following commands in console.
