\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}
The approaches for the SRS verification plan can be peer reviews from other teams, reviews from our group and reviews from TAs. An SRS checklist will be used to verify all the requirements for the project. The requirements will be verified using the system tests that are listed in detail in the SystemTest Description section.


\subsection{Design Verification Plan}
Similar to the SRS verification plan, the approaches involve peer reviews from teammates and other teams and the reviews from TAs. Their feedback can be utilized to verify our design. In addition, the checklists for MG and MIS are also approaches for the design verification to ensure that the actual device is implemented under the project’s goal and scope.

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}
Implementation verification is the process of reviewing, testing and verifying that the device is working correctly under the desired performance. Both dynamic and static techniques will be utilized for the verification. The dynamic techniques include the system tests that are listed in the next section for the implementation of the functional and nonfunctional requirements for the device. 
Unit tests should also be performed during the implementation verification plan. In terms of the static techniques, code inspection and code walkthrough should be done for every single line of code that will be added to the main script by at least two team members before uploading. And for any new changes that need to be fixed in the program, the whole team should review and agree with the new implementation before uploading the new changes to avoid the potential risk and problem for the project.
\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

As stated in the Development Plan \citep{DevPlan}, unit testing is planned to be accomplished through the use of the Pytest Unit Testing framework. Code coverage can also 
be determined using this same framework using the pytest-cov plugin. The framework would enable us to utilize automated testing; however, unit tests have 
not been developed for the current phase of the project.\\
~\\
For performance testing, there are options available such as the utilization of OpenCV’s getTickCount() and getTickFrequency() which can be used to 
calculate the FPS of the camera. In addition, there is also the use of Python’s own time library function, time.perf\_counter(), enabling us to measure 
the execution time of our code.\\
~\\
In terms of code verification, the code for the project will loosely follow the \href{https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/}{PEP8 Python coding standard}. 
The linter that the project will use is the Flake8 linter for Python which will enable us to conform to this coding standard and catch syntactic errors that 
the code may have.

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

The software will be validated through blackbox and white box  testing. The whitebox testing is used to validate the inner working of the project such as coding. The only input for our device is the hand gestures from the users, so the blackbox testing can be adopted to ensure that the correct word is outputted. Various inputs are needed for the validation process and it can be achieved by having different users perform different hand gestures.

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{User Experience Survey Questions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item On a scale of 1-10, how easy was it to learn the functions of the device (10 = very easy to learn, 1 = very difficult to learn)? Was there anything in 
  particular that you found confusing about the device?
  \item Does the system translate your signs fast enough? Was there any delay in its processing?
  \item At any point, did you have to slow down your signing for the machine to correctly process your signing?
  \item On a scale of 1-10, how portable would you say the device is? (10 = very portable, 1 = not portable at all) Was there anything in particular that made 
  the device less portable? (too large and bulky, too fragile, connections get loose, etc.)
  \item Does the hand tracking require you to reposition the camera repeatedly? Is this a major inconvenience?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reflection}
\begin{outline}[enumerate]
  \1 What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge, static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, etc. You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member
    \2 filler
  \1 For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill? Of the identified approaches, which will each team member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
  \\
  Jiahui Chen: TestProject\\
  In order to successfully complete the verification and validation plans for the project, knowledge of TestProject is needed for end-to-end testing. End-to-end testing is a software testing method to test the workflow of the application from the beginning to the end to ensure the application performs as expected.
   TestProject, a Python testing framework. will be used for the end-to-end testing in our project. TestProject can develop automation framework easily for generic purposes with the Python open source SDK, it can also support PyTest which will be used for unit testing. 
   Some approaches to acquire the knowledge of TestProject are self-study online tutorials such as watching the tutorials on Test Automation, take courses on udemy or ask other teams who are proficient on TestProject for help. The approach that our team will pursue is watching online tutorials on our own. 
   Because we can find all the knowledge we need for the project and there are many tutorial websites and videos available on the websites. And online tutorials offer a more flexible learning time.
