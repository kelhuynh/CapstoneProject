  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

The objectives to be fulfilled by utilizing the VnV plan are as follows:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Building confidence that the software was implemented correctly for the purpose of the project
  \item Ensuring that OpenASL displays adequate usability for its intended purpose. See \textbf{Problem Statement} documentation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

The relevant documentation used to formulate the VnV plan include:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Problem Statement
  \item SRS
  \item Hazard Analysis
  \item Development Plan
\end{itemize}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\captionof{table}{Verification and Validation Team Members and Roles}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}
The approaches for the SRS verification plan can be peer reviews from other teams, reviews from our group and reviews from TAs.


\subsection{Design Verification Plan}
Similar to the SRS verification plan, the approaches involve peer reviews from teammates and other teams and the reviews from TAs.


\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
  the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
  inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

The software will be validated through blackbox and white box  testing. The whitebox testing is used to validate the inner working of the project such as coding. The only input for our device is the hand gestures from the users, so the blackbox testing can be adopted to ensure that the correct word is outputted. Various inputs are needed for the validation process and it can be achieved by having different users perform different hand gestures.

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.}

% \section{Unit Test Description}

% \wss{Reference your MIS and explain your overall philosophy for test case
%   selection.}  
% \wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has
%   been completed.}

% \subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

% \wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
%   developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
%   verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
%   have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
%   explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

% \subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

% \wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
%   appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
%   technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

% \subsubsection{Module 1}

% \wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
%   References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
%   perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
%   tests were selected.}

% \subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

% \wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
%   performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
%   nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

% \wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
%   mentioned functional tests.}
