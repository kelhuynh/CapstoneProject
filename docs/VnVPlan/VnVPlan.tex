\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

The relevant documentation used to formulate the VnV plan include:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Problem Statement
  \item SRS
  \item Hazard Analysis
  \item Development Plan
\end{itemize}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\captionof{table}{Verification and Validation Team Members and Roles}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}
The approaches for the SRS verification plan can be peer reviews from other teams, reviews from our group and reviews from TAs.


\subsection{Design Verification Plan}
Similar to the SRS verification plan, the approaches involve peer reviews from teammates and other teams and the reviews from TAs.


\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
  the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
  inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

As stated in the Development Plan, unit testing is planned to be accomplished through the use of the Pytest Unit Testing framework. Code coverage can also 
be determined using this same framework using the pytest-cov plugin. The framework would enable us to utilize automated testing; however, unit tests have 
not been developed for the current phase of the project.\\
~\\
For performance testing, there are options available such as the utilization of OpenCV’s getTickCount() and getTickFrequency() which can be used to 
calculate the FPS of the camera. In addition, there is also the use of Python’s own time library function, time.perf\_counter(), enabling us to measure 
the execution time of our code.\\
~\\
In terms of code verification, the code for the project will loosely follow the PEP8 Python Coding Standard. The linter that the project will use is the 
Flake8 linter for Python which will enable us to conform to this coding standard and catch syntactic errors that the code may have.

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

The software will be validated through blackbox and white box  testing. The whitebox testing is used to validate the inner working of the project such as coding. The only input for our device is the hand gestures from the users, so the blackbox testing can be adopted to ensure that the correct word is outputted. Various inputs are needed for the validation process and it can be achieved by having different users perform different hand gestures.

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints

% \wss{Reference your MIS and explain your overall philosophy for test case
%   selection.}  
% \wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has
%   been completed.}

% \subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

% \wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
%   developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
%   verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
%   have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
%   explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

% \subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

% \wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
%   appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
%   technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

% \subsubsection{Module 1}

% \wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
%   References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
%   perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{User Experience Survey Questions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item On a scale of 1-10, how easy was it to learn the functions of the device (10 = very easy to learn, 1 = very difficult to learn)? Was there anything in 
  particular that you found confusing about the device?
  \item Does the system translate your signs fast enough? Was there any delay in its processing?
  \item At any point, did you have to slow down your signing for the machine to correctly process your signing?
  \item On a scale of 1-10, how portable would you say the device is? (10 = very portable, 1 = not portable at all) Was there anything in particular that made 
  the device less portable? (too large and bulky, too fragile, connections get loose, etc.)
  \item Does the hand tracking require you to reposition the camera repeatedly? Is this a major inconvenience?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reflection}
\begin{outline}[enumerate]
  \1 What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge, static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, etc. You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member
    \2 filler
  \1 For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill? Of the identified approaches, which will each team member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
