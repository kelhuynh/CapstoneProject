\begin{itemize}
  \item Problem Statement
  \item SRS

\end{itemize}

\section{Plan}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may just
  be ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may have
  something more rigorous/systematic in mind..}

\wss{Remember you have an SRS checklist}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Remember you have MG and MIS checklists}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
  the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
  inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}
		
\paragraph{Title for Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}
					
How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}
		
\paragraph{Title for Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: 
					
Initial State: 
					
Input/Condition: 
					
Output/Result: 
					
How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Static etc.
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: 
					
How test will be performed: 

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing2}

...

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{Reference your MIS and explain your overall philosophy for test case
  selection.}  
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has
  been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 

\item{...\\}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\subsubsection{Module ?}
		
\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}

\section{Appendix}

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

\wss{This is a section that would be appropriate for some projects.}
