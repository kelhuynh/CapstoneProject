\section{Introduction}

This document is a hazard analysis of Group 20\textquotesingle s ASL Translator. The ASL Translator is a real-time sign language translation device intended to aid 
individuals who are hard of hearing in day to day communication tasks. This device may also be used for the purpose of facilitating the learning of 
sign language in an educational setting.\\

\section{Scope and Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to identify hazards that may occur when using the ASL Translator specifically in the components, their causes and consequences on user 
operation, hazard mitigation, and their respective safety requirements.\\

The definition of a hazard is based on the definition from Nancy Levesonâ€™s work. A hazard is a property or condition in the system along with a condition in the
environment that results in a loss. A hazard is anything that can cause our system to function incorrectly, or not function at all. In the ASL Translator, there
exists only hazards that affect safety during operation.\\
