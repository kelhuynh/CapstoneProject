\section{Introduction}

This document is a hazard analysis of Group 20\textquotesingle s ASL Translator. The ASL Translator is a real-time sign language translation device intended to aid 
individuals who are hard of hearing in day to day communication tasks. This device may also be used for the purpose of facilitating the learning of 
sign language in an educational setting.\\

\section{Scope and Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to identify hazards that may occur when using the ASL Translator specifically in the components, their causes and consequences on user 
operation, hazard mitigation, and their respective safety requirements.\\

\section{System Boundaries}

\section{Definition of Hazard}

The definition of a hazard is based on the definition from Nancy Leveson\textquotesingle s work. A hazard is a property or condition in the system along with a condition in the
environment that results in a loss. A hazard is anything that can cause our system to function incorrectly, or not function at all. In the ASL Translator, there
exists only hazards that affect safety during operation.\\


\section{Critical Assumptions}

\section{Failure Modes and Effects Analysis}

The hazard analysis tool being used is the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). This will enable hazard identification and analysis such that additional safety requirements can 
be created and considered in the implementation of the project.\\

\subsection{Hazards Out of Scope}

The out of scope hazards for our project is primarily based on the user\textquotesingle s decision. This is because we do not have control over the following:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item The camera that is to be used in conjunction with the system
    \item The Raspberry Pi model and microSD card capacity being used
\end{itemize}

Both components listed above are essential to the functionality of the system. However, there is no enforcement on these aspects as the user may prefer something 
less costly or more costly. The user\textquotesingle s decision towards these components may vary and can affect the overall performance of the system. Steps will be taken to minimize 
the impact of the user\textquotesingle s choice in these categories such as ensuring backwards compatibility is possible with our implementation of code on the Raspberry Pi and camera 
calibration methods.\\

Below is the FMEA table for the project.\\
