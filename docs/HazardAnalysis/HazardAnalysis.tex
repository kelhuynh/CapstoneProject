\section{Introduction}

This document is a hazard analysis of Group 20\textquotesingle s ASL Translator. The ASL Translator is a real-time sign language translation device intended to aid 
individuals who are hard of hearing in day to day communication tasks. This device may also be used for the purpose of facilitating the learning of 
sign language in an educational setting.\\

\section{Scope and Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to identify hazards that may occur when using the ASL Translator specifically in the components, their causes and consequences on user 
operation, hazard mitigation, and their respective requirements.\\

\section{System Boundaries}

The device being referred to in the hazard analysis consists of the following components:

1. A Raspberry Pi\\
2. A camera\\
3. A machine learning model for ASL\\
4. A hand tracking script\\

The system boundaries include the raspberry pi, its machine learning model and hand tracking script, and the camera. Despite the choice of raspberry pi model and camera model being influenced by the user and out of control of the developers, it is important to include these components as they are core to the systemâ€™s operation. Therefore, a hazard analysis on these components will still be included.


\section{Definition of Hazard}

The definition of a hazard is based on the definition from Nancy Leveson\textquotesingle s work. A hazard is a property or condition in the system along with a condition in the
environment that results in a loss. A hazard is anything that can cause our system to function incorrectly, or not function at all. In the ASL Translator, there
exists only hazards that affect the proper and intended operation of the device.\\


\section{Critical Assumptions}
At this time, there are no critical assumptions to be made.

\section{Failure Modes and Effects Analysis}

The hazard analysis tool being used is the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). This will enable hazard identification and analysis such that additional safety requirements can 
be created and considered in the implementation of the project.\\

\subsection{Hazards Out of Scope}

The out of scope hazards for our project is primarily based on the user\textquotesingle s decision. This is because we do not have control over the following:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item The camera that is to be used in conjunction with the system
    \item The Raspberry Pi model and microSD card capacity being used
\end{itemize}

Both components listed above are essential to the functionality of the system. However, there is no enforcement on these aspects as the user may prefer something 
less costly or more costly. The user\textquotesingle s decision towards these components may vary and can affect the overall performance of the system. Steps will be taken to minimize 
the impact of the user\textquotesingle s choice in these categories such as ensuring backwards compatibility is possible with our implementation of code on the Raspberry Pi and camera 
calibration methods.\\

\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Hardware Requirement}
HR1: The Raspberry Pi board should be checked and tested before using it in the project.\\
HR2: The camera should be checked before each use to ensure the lenses are clean and working properly.
\subsection{Environment Requirement}
ER1: Ensure there is adequate lighting so the camera can detect and translate the hand motions.
\subsection{Machine Learning Requirement}
MLR1: Dataset should be properly chosen and verified, sufficient amount of data should be included in the dataset. Preprocessing should be done on the dataset for standardization and normalization.\\
MLR2: ML model should be properly chosen and tested, parameters optimization should be done for balanced results and optimized performance.
\subsection{Script Requirement}
SR1: Various software testing (Black box testing, White box testing, etc) should be performed on the script before it is flashed onto the board.\\
SR2: Complete functionality testing should be performed after the code is flashed onto the board.

\section{Roadmap}
The hazard analysis has resulted in new safety requirements that were not considered in the initial revision of the 
System Requirements Specification (SRS). Given the current time and budget constraints, while some hazards will be accounted 
for and removed, some hazards might still remain in the final revision of the project. These hazards that may not be addressed may include
model inaccuracy and Raspberry Pi hardware failure/failure to display results. This is primarily due to the intensive training needed
for an accurate machine learning model and due to the hardware limitations of a Raspberry Pi as the project develops. In these cases, notices 
will be provided to the user to ensure safety and proper regulation. Throughout the next steps of the project, the hazard analysis will continuously 
be consulted to determine risks that have already been considered in the implementation and risks that will be removed in future updates.
