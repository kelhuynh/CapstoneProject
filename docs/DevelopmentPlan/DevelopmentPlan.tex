\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Technology}

The coding for the project will be done in Python3 utilizing Flake8 as the linter 
to ensure error-free and idiomatic code. Unit testing for the Python code will be done 
through the use of the Pytest framework where various tests can be defined based on the 
intended code functionality. The same framework of which can and will be used to generate 
a measure of code coverage through the pytest-cov plugin. Continuous integration (CI) is 
planned to be used to ensure that coding errors and bugs are detected within a reasonable 
amount of time, however the specifics are to be determined as the group is unfamiliar with 
implementing the concept at this time. Libraries that are currently planned for use include 
OpenCV, Tensorflow, and Pyserial for serial communication with an Arduino board. Performance 
measuring tools will be used appropriately as the need arises, but some examples would include 
OpenCV\textquotesingle s getTickCount() and getTickFrequency() functions as well as Python\textquotesingle 
s time.perf\textunderscore counter() function to track execution time of code. Additional tools 
may be declared as the need arises.
